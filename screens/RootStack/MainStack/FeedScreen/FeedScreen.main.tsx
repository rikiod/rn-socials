/* HOW TYPESCRIPT WORKS WITH PROPS:

  Remember the navigation-related props from Project 2? They were called `route` and `navigation`,
  and they were passed into our screen components by React Navigation automatically.  We accessed parameters 
  passed to screens through `route.params` , and navigated to screens using `navigation.navigate(...)` and 
  `navigation.goBack()`. In this project, we explicitly define the types of these props at the top of 
  each screen component.

  Now, whenever we type `navigation.`, our code editor will know exactly what we can do with that object, 
  and it'll suggest `.goBack()` as an option. It'll also tell us when we're trying to do something 
  that isn't supported by React Navigation! */

}

export default function FeedScreen({ navigation }: Props) {
  // TODO: Initialize a list of SocialModel objects in state.
  const [SocialModel, setSocialModel] = useState([]);

  /* TYPESCRIPT HINT: 
    When we call useState(), we can define the type of the state
    variable using something like this:
        const [myList, setMyList] = useState<MyModelType[]>([]); */
  
  const [myFeed, setFeed] = useState<SocialModel[]>([]);

    TODO: In a useEffect hook, start a Firebase observer to listen to the "socials" node in Firestore.

    Reminders:
      1. Make sure you start a listener that's attached to this node!
      2. The onSnapshot method returns a method. Make sure to return the method
          in your useEffect, so that it's called and the listener is detached when
          this component is killed. 
          Read More: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/listen#detach_a_listener
      3. You'll probably want to use the .orderBy method to order by a particular key.
      4. It's probably wise to make sure you can create new socials before trying to 
          load socials on this screen.
